# mario_towers
In the game Mario, before completing each level, Mario must jump from a pyramid of blocks onto a flag pole.

Your mission is to recreate these blocks using Ruby. 


# Half pyramid
- Write a program that creates a half pyramind. This should take in user input and build a pyramid to the height specified.
- For example, when the program runs and the user inputs `6`, the following pyramid should return:  
```ruby
     # 
    ## 
   ### 
  #### 
 ##### 
###### 
```

# Full pyramid

- Write program that asks a user how tall they would like to make the pyramid. This should be a non-negative integer no greater than 23 (this is the tallest that a pyramid can be in Mario land).
- For example, when the program runs and the user inputs `3`, the following pyramid should return:  
```ruby
     # #
    ## ##
   ### ###
```
- When the program runs and the user inputs `6`, the following pyramid should return:  
```ruby
     # #
    ## ##
   ### ###

###### ######
```

##### Note: This lab is taught in the Harvard CS50 course that is taught in Java, but you'll be creating it in Ruby!  
##### GOOD LUCK!
