# calculator_project
- Challenge: Build a Command Line Calculator application
- Group size: 2-3 students  

# pre-code
When working on any project, it is always best to consider how your calculator will operate.  
- What operations will it include?  
- Will it include a menu?  
- What methods are required?  
- Before coding, use **pseudo code** to hash out any challenges you might predict so that when you get to writing your methods, everything is logically sound
- Consider everyone in your group and switch up who is the "driver" to give everyone an opportunity to contribute to the project

# mvp
**MVP**: Minimum Viable Product. This term is widely used when introducing and building new features and applications. This term is extremely important because it is easy to get ahead of ourselves when building something new. We usually want to do too much too quickly...   

When building your calculator, first determine your MVP, *what is the most basic functioning version of your calculator do you want to have done?*.   

Once this is complete, then you begin to add features to your MVP. The goal is for everyone to have a fully functional MVP command line calculator by the end of class, even if it simply adds and subtracts.

# challenges
Feel free to add functions to your calculator once you have an MVP  
- A calucator that can do complex math functions (square root, sine/cosine/tangent, etc.)
- A calculator that continues running until a user selects an "exit" option
- A calculator that can take more than 2 number inputs as arguments (i.e. `2 + 2 + 2`, `3 + 5 + 6 + 7`, `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`)  

##### Good luck!
