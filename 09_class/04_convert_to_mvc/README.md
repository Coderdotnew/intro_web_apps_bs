# convert_to_MVC
Before we build an application of our own, let's practice using one of the code challenges you have already completed. The challenge must first be converted into a class using object-oriented programming (this was completed for several challenges in the previous class).  

Some recommendations for this MVC conversion challenge are:
- Caesar Cipher
- FizzBuzz
- Mario (this one is a bit tougher, especially if you want to display images of bricks)
- Email Parser
- Cash Register
- Secret Handshake (get creative with this one)
- Triangle Classification
- Temperature Conversion
- Rock, Paper, Scissors

# mvp
Don't worry yet about styling the view for this application. Remember, the goal is to always have a functioning **MVP**, or a Minimum Viable Product, that performs the most basic function of your application.

# notes
Collaborate with your team as much as possible and feel free to refer to any resources you have, including the Sinatra template. Keep the following in mind:
- Design your program in a Ruby file first. Ensure your object is instantiated properly and can access the attributes that are required.
- Create a form that fulfills the needs of your object design
  - How many textboxes do you need?
  - Do you need a different input field type than textbox?
  - What type of data is needed to be input by the user and how does this affect your object in your overall MVC application design?
- Double check your form `action` and `method` fields. They must match the routing of your application controller as well as the naming convention for your parameters you will be passing around
- File structure naming conventions are critical -- name your models and views to match the theme of your application. For example, `status.rb` might not be the best name if your model does not post statuses.

#### Have fun and get creative! This is your chance to combine your backend and frontend skills. 
#### Remember, collaboration is KEY!
