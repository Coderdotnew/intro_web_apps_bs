# mvc_project
Project mode time. The goal is to apply as many of the concepts you can. So far you have had exposure to Ruby, HTML, CSS, and API's. Even though our primary goal is a simple MVP, push yourself to create something you are proud of and will continue to build on, even after this class is done!  

It's important to consider our limitations:
- We do not have a **database**, meaning there is no where to store our user information. This means we cannot log on and save your session. Every time the app is used is a new *instance* for our application (don't worry, you can build a lot without a database persisting your information).
- We are working in teams, meaning we need to collaborate and be open-minded to new ideas and implementations. There might be 100 ways to build the same project!
- Time! We have limited time to build an entire app! So work fast, but enjoy your time building and innovating, even if the app doesn't live up to your wildest dreams and expectatinos (you have an entire life of coding, don't worry too much about time).

# ideation
Try to spend nore more than 10 - 15 minutes brainstorming. This app is meant to be a fun, silly app that you can show your family and friends. It is more important to truly understand *every line of code* that is written in your app! You may want to build:
- An app that can text your friends jokes
- An app that can message your friends funny gifs
- An ad-lib machine
- An app that generates a gif based on your mood
- A joke machine that generates jokes for a user
- An app that can look up the stats of a sports player
- An app that can look up which college is right for you
- A travel guide for people visiting Arizona based on their interests or age
- An encryption machine that encrypts or decrypts messages
- A random inspirational quote generator
- An app that texts a gif to your friends
- A guide for students applying to college
- A beautiful dashboard that displays weather, Tweets, quotes, or any other widgets you prefer
- A recipe generator
- YOUR OWN IDEA!

To reiterate: planning and executing a minimum viable product is essential.  

1. Make it work.
2. Make it work even better.
3. Make it work until it breaks.
4. Fix it.
5. Make it look pretty.
6. Make it work even better.
7. Repeat.

As Mark Zuckerber famously said, **"Move fast and break things."**  

The most important step is step 1. A simple functioning app is better than a broken complex app. Work in stages and collaborate. Step outside of your comfort zone and don't be afraid to break your app! Utilize the strengths of your team members. The best way to really learn something is to teach it.

#### API's  
- Some apps may want to incorporate an API, such as weather, Giphy, or Twilio. 
- More information can be found in the [Coder.new API README Guides](https://github.com/Coderdotnew/intro_web_apps_dgm/tree/master/11_class/APIs) 

#### JavaScript  
- Almost all applications today incorporate JavaScript. A computer programming language that makes webpages interactive and animated. While **HTML** adds the content of the webpage and **CSS** styles the content, **JavaScript** makes this material more interactive. You may have seen a logo move across the page, or a web application that has *autoscroll*, or *carousel* that slides images across a webpage. This is all thanks to JavaScript!  
- **jQuery** is a JavaScript library that makes implementing JavaScript into your web application a bit easier. There are many jQuery plugins that are pre-written for you to explore and use. 
- More information on jQuery can be found in the [w3schools Tutorials](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/) or by Googling, "jQuery plugins"


#### Now, all that's left it to just do it

#### Note: The next 3 lessons focus on hashes, a multi-dimensional datastructure that is *optional*. If you hope to use an API, it is *highly* recommended you read through the Hashes lessons.
