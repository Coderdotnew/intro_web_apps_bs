# return the number of keys






# return the number of values 





# add oregon and its capital, Salem to the hash and return the hash






# delete utah entirely from the hash





# upcase the hawaii capital






# update arizona capital to Phoenix






# challenge: convert the capitals hash to an array using the .to_a method
# iterate through the arrays to print out: "The capital of ____ is _____." for each state and capital 
# note: you must complete the previous methods so your hash has the most up to date values
