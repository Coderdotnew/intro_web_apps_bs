# create a method, fizzbuzz_loops, that takes in 1 argument, num
# define a loop that outputs each number between 1 and the number input as the argument
# if the number is divisible by 3, output Fizz
# if the number is divisible by 5, output Buzz
# if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, ouput FizzBuzz
# otherwise, output the number
