# fizzbuzz_loops
Time to extend that FizzBuzz challenge. This time, write a program that uses a loop to print each number from 1 to the input number (argument). 

The rules are the same:
- print `"Fizz"` if the number being printed is divisible by 3 
- print `"Buzz"` if the number being printed is divisible by 5 
- print `"FizzBuzz"` if the number being printed is divisible by 3 AND 5
- print the number if the number being printed is neither divisible by 3 or 5

You should see the following output on your Terminal screen if 16 is passed in as the number argument.
```ruby
# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz
# Fizz
# 7
# 8
# Fizz
# Buzz
# 11
# Fizz
# 13
# 14
# FizzBuzz
# 16
```
