end



# create a method, while_loop, that takes 0 arguments
# use a while loop to do the exact same thing as the expected_outcome method 








# create a method, until_loop, that takes 0 arguments
# use an until loop to do the exact same thing as the expected_outcome method 







# create a method, for_loop, that takes 0 arguments
# use a for loop to do the exact same thing as the expected_outcome method
