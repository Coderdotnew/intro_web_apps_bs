# best buy is having a crazy sale for black friday... they are giving away free TVs!
# there's a catch, though, they are selecting a random number between 1 and 10 but not telling how many, so it could be 1 or 10 or any number in between
# create a method, best_buy, that takes in 1 default argument, num_tvs, set to a random number that ranges between 1 and 10 (including 1 and 10)
# create a counter and define a loop that increments the line number 
# as long as the line counter is less than the number of tvs, increase the line length and output the line number followed by "You get a TV!"
# once the loop breaks, return the number of people that get a tv









# example output if the random number generated is 4
# 1: You get a TV!
# 2: You get a TV!
# 3: You get a TV!
# 4: You get a TV!
#=> "4 people get a TV!"

# NOTE: if you run rspec multiple times once it passes, you will see the output is random each time!
