# black_friday
Best Buy is having a crazy sale for black friday... they are giving away free TVs! There's a catch, though, they are selecting a random number of TVs to give out between 1 and 10 but not telling how many, so it could be 1 or 10 or any number in between. Write a program that counts the number of people in line that get a TV using a counter and then return how many TVs were given out!  

Your should see the following output upon running `rspec`.  
```ruby
# 1: You get a TV!
# 2: You get a TV!
# 3: You get a TV!
# 4: You get a TV!
#=> "4 people get a TV!"  # this is the return value if the counter reaches 4
```
