# snooze
Admit it, you probably hit the snooze button at least once before actually getting out of bed. Use your knowledge of loops to create a program that let's you know how many times you can hit snooze until you have to get out of bed.  

Your should see the following output upon running `rspec`.  
```ruby
# I can hit snooze 6 more times
# I can hit snooze 5 more times
# I can hit snooze 4 more times
# I can hit snooze 3 more times
# I can hit snooze 2 more times
# I can hit snooze 1 more times
#=> "TIME TO GO!"
```
