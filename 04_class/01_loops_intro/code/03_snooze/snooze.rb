# create a method, snooze, that takes in 2 arguments, num_times_wanna_snooze and min_until_leave
# every snooze is 10 minutes long
# define a loop that will determine how many snoozes you have left
# return "TIME TO GO!" when there is no more time for snoozes because there is less than 10 minutes before you have to leave!
# hint: you need to subtract time from the minutes_until_leave in each loop















# the following output should be printed to your terminal screen if you call snooze(6,65)
# I can hit snooze 6 more times
# I can hit snooze 5 more times
# I can hit snooze 4 more times
# I can hit snooze 3 more times
# I can hit snooze 2 more times
# I can hit snooze 1 more times
#=> "TIME TO GO!"
