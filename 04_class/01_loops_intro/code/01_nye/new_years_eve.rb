# create a method, countdown_to_midnight, that takes in 1 argument, countdown
# defined a loop with a counter that subtracts 1 every loop (counts down)
# every loop, output the number of seconds to the screen (example shown below)
# after the loop ends, return "HAPPY NEW YEAR" 











# the following output should be printed to your terminal screen when you run rspec
# 10 
# 9 
# 8 
# 7 
# 6 
# 5 
# 4 
# 3 
# 2 
# 1 
#=> "HAPPY NEW YEAR!"



# Once you have passed the rspec test...
# Challenge: google how to add a "sleep" method that makes Ruby wait 1 second between each loop and add this method so your method counts down to midnight when run
