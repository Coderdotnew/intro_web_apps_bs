# secret_handshake
Computers speak in binary, so it's time for you to as well! Code a `SecretHandshake` class that takes in a string of `1`s and `0`s and returns a secret handshake based on the order of the string!  
  
**Secret Handshake rules:**    
- "1" = "high five"  
- "10" = "fist bump"  
- "100" = "low five"  
- "1000" = "jump spin"  
- "10000" = Reverse the order of the actions

The Secret Handshake for `"101"` is `"high five low five"` (Notice there is no `"1"` in the `"fist bump"` index).  

The Secret Handshake for `"1011"` is `"high five fist bump jump spin"` (Notice there is no `"1"` in the `"low five"` index).
