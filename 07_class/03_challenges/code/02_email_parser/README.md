# email_parser
Another email parser! This time, we are wrapping our logic inside a class. Our goal is to include a method, `parse`, that parses through the emails passed when instantiating the object.  

A single email, or multiple emails separated by a comma can be passed in (CSV, or comma separated values) as a string. An array of emails is *not* being passed in, but rather a *string* of email(s).  

- Note 1: to **parse** is to divide a a group of items into smaller parts to analyze each part(i.e. parsing a sentence would be to divide it into words and identify each component of the sentence)
- Note 2: a **delimiter** is a character that separates words or phrases in a text string
- Note 3: a **CSV** file is a comma separated value file that uses commas as a delimeter (spaces are also common delimeters)
