# OOP_project
- Challenge: Build a command line application that replicates a popular app using object-oriented program design
- Ideas: Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Pinterest, AirBnB, Kickstarter (or create your own!)
- Group size: 2-4 students
- Build your app inside `oo_project.rb` (notice there is already a spec directory there, just in case :wink:)
# pre-code
- Consider the primary functionality of your app
-- What attributes is your class instantiated with?
-- Which of those attributes are accessible to users?
-- What attributes are defined after initialization? 
- Before coding, use **pseudo code** to hash out any challenges you might predict so that when you get to writing your methods, everything is logically sound
- Consider everyone in your group and switch up who is the "driver" to give everyone an opportunity to contribute to the project

# mvp
**MVP**: Minimum Viable Product. This term is widely used when introducing and building new features and applications. This term is extremely important because it is easy to get ahead of ourselves when building something new. We usually want to do too much too quickly...   

When building your application, first determine what your MVP will be, *what is the most basic functioning version of your calculator do you want to have done?*.   

Once this is complete, then you begin to add features to your MVP. The goal is for everyone to have a fully functional MVP command line calculator by the end of class, even if it simply adds and subtracts.

# possible_features
1. Add friends to an array
2. Send a specific friend a message
3. Send a picture (or gif or video)
4. More ways to interact with friends (messages, wall, blog posts, etc)
5. Any other specific functionality (profile picture, favorites, best friends, usernames, confirmation emails, disappearing pictures, etc)

# rspec_challenge
By now, you've read a lot of RSpec files. You should have a feel for the syntax, the file structure, and the varbiage...if you build a program and you want to take it to the next level, build a few tests inside of your rspec file to practice your TDD (test driven development) and to make sure your app is doing what it's supposed to :+1:
