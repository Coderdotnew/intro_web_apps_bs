# create a method, firstname_from_email, that takes in an array of names as an argument
# the method should parse through the emails and return an array of only the first name from each email
# create an array that returns an array with each first name taken before the @ symbol from the $coderdotnew array











# create an array that returns an array of full names that comes before the @ symbol for each email in the google array
# hint: you must return a name that has a capitalized first and last name (may want to google this)
