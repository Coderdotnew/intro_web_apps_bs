# create a method, first_event, that takes in an events array as an arguments
# return the first item in the array





# create a method, remove_first, that takes in an events array as an arguments
# remove the first item from the array





# create a method, update_event_list, that takes in an events array as an arguments

# create a method, order_events, that takes in an events array as an arguments
# your goal is to iterate through each array index value and return a new array
